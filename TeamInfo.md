## Project Summary
  REWIND aims to utilize the Spotify API to curate playlists of popular songs based on different attributes. By separating the data into songs, artists, and users, we will be able to efficiently sort through all the data on Spotify to make the best playlists for each user's wants. 
  
  The UI for REWIND will be simple, but effective. We want it to look good next to the actual Spotify interface and be easy for anyone to use. To use the playlist generator, each user must create a login that will connect them to all the playlists that they generated in the past. REWIND will make it easy for anyone to find music based off of what they already like and will generate an actual scannable Spotify code and link so they can make it an addition to their actual Spotify account.
